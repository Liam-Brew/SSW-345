# Summary
I was able to complete the majority of this assignment using only GitHub's provided REST documentation. Once again, I am familiar with node and express, so there wasn't much technical difficulty on that end. While the REST syntax was new for me, I was able to understand it fairly quickly. I have used it before but through wrappers, so it was nice to see how the base API operates.
